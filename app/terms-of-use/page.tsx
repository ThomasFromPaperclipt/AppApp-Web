                        Geography

                        AppApp Services are directed to users in the United States. The Services are controlled and operated from the United States. AppApp makes no representations that the Services are appropriate or available for use in other locations. Those who access or use the Services from other jurisdictions do so of their own volition and are entirely responsible for compliance with all applicable local laws and regulations, including but not limited to export and import regulations. You may not use the Services if you are a resident outside the United States, of a country embargoed by the United States, or are a foreign person or entity blocked or denied by the United States government. Unless otherwise explicitly stated, all materials found on the Services are solely directed to individuals, companies, or other entities located in the United States.

                        Assignment

                        These Terms of Service are assignable only by AppApp. These Terms of Service, and any rights and licenses granted hereunder, may not be transferred or assigned by you, but may be transferred or assigned by AppApp without restriction.

                        Controlling Law and Jurisdiction

                        You agree that: (i) the Services shall be deemed solely based in Pennsylvania; and (ii) the Services shall be deemed passive that do not give rise to personal jurisdiction over AppApp, either specific or general, in jurisdictions other than Pennsylvania. You expressly agree that your rights and obligations, these Terms of Service and any disputes shall be governed by and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the state of Pennsylvania, excluding its choice of law rules. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any claim or dispute between you and AppApp that arises in whole or in part from the Services shall be decided exclusively by a court of competent jurisdiction located in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, unless submitted to arbitration in accordance with the Dispute Resolution section of these Terms of Service. The foregoing sentence shall not apply to North Carolina consumers. You also acknowledge and agree that you are waiving the right to participate as a plaintiff or class in any purported class action or representative proceeding. Further, unless both you and AppApp otherwise agree in writing, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of any class or representative proceeding.

                        Dispute Resolution

                        You and AppApp agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms of Service or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof, or to the use of the Services or use of the Site (collectively, “Disputes”) will be settled by binding arbitration, except that each party retains the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party’s copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property rights.

                        You acknowledge and agree that you and AppApp are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class action or representative proceeding. Further, unless both you and AppApp otherwise agree in writing, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of any class or representative proceeding. If this specific paragraph is held unenforceable, then the entirety of this “Dispute Resolution” section will be deemed void. Except as provided in the preceding sentence, this “Dispute Resolution” section will survive any termination of these Terms of Service.

                        Arbitration Rules and Governing Law

                        The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (the “AAA Rules”) then in effect, except as modified by this “Dispute Resolution” section. (The AAA Rules are available at www.adr.org/rules or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.) The Federal Arbitration Act will govern the interpretation and enforcement of this section.

                        Arbitration process

                        A party who desires to initiate arbitration must provide the other party with a written Demand for Arbitration as specified in the AAA Rules. (The AAA provides a form Demand for Arbitration) The arbitrator will be either a retired judge or an attorney licensed to practice law in the state of Pennsylvania and will be selected by the parties from the AAA’s roster of consumer dispute arbitrators. If the parties are unable to agree upon an arbitrator within seven (7) days of delivery of the Demand for Arbitration, then the AAA will appoint the arbitrator in accordance with the AAA Rules.

                        Arbitration location and procedure

                        Unless you and AppApp otherwise agree, the arbitration will be conducted in the county where you reside. If your claim does not exceed $10,000, then the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents you and AppApp submit to the arbitrator, unless you request a hearing or the arbitrator determines that a hearing is necessary. If your claim exceeds $10,000, your right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. Subject to the AAA Rules, the arbitrator will have the discretion to direct a reasonable exchange of information by the parties, consistent with the expedited nature of the arbitration.

                        Arbitrator’s Decision

                        The arbitrator will render an award within the time frame specified in the AAA Rules. The arbitrator’s decision will include the essential findings and conclusions upon which the arbitrator based the award. Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The arbitrator’s award damages must be consistent with the terms of the “Limitation of Liability” section above as to the types and the amounts of damages for which a party may be held liable. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the claimant and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the claimant’s individual claim. If you prevail in arbitration you will be entitled to an award of attorneys’ fees and expenses, to the extent provided under applicable law.

                        Fees

                        Notwithstanding the provisions of the “Modifications” section above, if AppApp makes material changes to this “Dispute Resolution” section after the date you first accepted these Terms of Service (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms of Service), you may reject any such change by sending us written notice (including by email) within 30 days of the date such change became effective, as indicated in the “Last Updated Date” above or in the date of AppApp’s email to you notifying you of such change.

                        Notification Procedures

                        AppApp may provide notifications, whether such notifications are required by law or are for marketing or other business related purposes, to you via email notice, written or hard copy notice, or through conspicuous posting of such notice on our website, as determined by AppApp in our sole discretion. AppApp reserves the right to determine the form and means of providing notifications to our users. AppApp is not responsible for any automatic filtering you or your network provider may apply to email notifications we send to the email address you provide us.

                        Severability

                        This is our entire agreement and if any portion is deemed invalid, the remaining provisions are valid. This Agreement, together with any amendments and any additional agreements you may enter into with AppApp in connection with the Service, shall constitute the entire agreement between you and AppApp concerning the Services. If any provision of this Agreement is deemed invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the invalidity of such provision shall not affect the validity of the remaining provisions of this Agreement, which shall remain in full force and effect.

                        No waiver of any term of these Terms of Service shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or any other term, and AppApp’s failure to assert any right or provision under these Terms of Service shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.
